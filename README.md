# Overview
This program calculates the perimeter and area of squares and triangles, and it displays the results on the screen.

# How it works
The way that this program works is by using the square and triangle classes. The square class uses four sides and the triangle class uses three sides. Both of the classes are 
written similarly, but they differ in how the area is calculated.

# Development Environment
This program was created using Visual Studio 2019 with C++.

# Future Work

* Allow a user to type in numbers for the length of each side
* Allow a user to choose a shape
* Add more shape classes and rules
